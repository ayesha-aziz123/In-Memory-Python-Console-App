# Constitution — Phase I: In-Memory Python Todo CLI App

## 1. Purpose
This constitution defines the rules for Phase I of the "Evolution of Todo" project.
All implementation must be spec-driven using Claude CLI + SpecKit Plus.
The developer will not write code manually; Claude must generate all source code from specs.

## 2. Project Scope
Create an in-memory Python CLI Todo application with the following features:
- Add Task
- View Tasks
- Update Task
- Delete Task
- Mark Complete / Incomplete

All tasks must exist only in memory (no database).
Application must run in a terminal using Python 3.13+.

## 3. Architecture Rules
- Source code lives under `phase-1-cli/src/todo/`.
- Keep modules small and single-responsibility.
- Use:
  - `models.py` → task model + dataclasses or simple classes
  - `storage.py` → in-memory storage abstraction
  - `services.py` → business logic
  - `cli.py` → command-line UI
  - `main.py` → entrypoint

## 4. Data Model
A Task must include:
- `id: int`
- `title: str`
- `description: str`
- `completed: bool` (default False)
- `created_at: str`
- `updated_at: str`

Timestamps must be ISO formatted using Python datetime.

## 5. Coding Standards
- Python 3.13
- Type hints required
- Docstrings for all classes/functions
- No external libraries
- Clean, readable, single-purpose functions
- No global mutable state outside the storage component

## 6. CLI Requirements
- User can add, list, update, delete, complete, incomplete tasks
- Simple commands: `add`, `list`, `update <id>`, `delete <id>`, `complete <id>`, `incomplete <id>`, `exit`, `help`
- CLI must print clear messages and handle invalid input gracefully

## 7. Tests
- Tests live in `phase-1-cli/tests/`
- Use pytest style
- Each feature must have at least one test
- Storage must reset per test (isolated state)

## 8. Spec-Driven Rules
Claude must follow this workflow:
1. `/sp.specify` → feature spec
2. `/sp.plan`
3. `/sp.task`
4. `/sp.implement`

Claude must:
- Not hallucinate files outside this structure
- Follow this constitution for every generation
- Update code only through the spec-driven workflow
- Generate tests first, then implementation

## 9. Completion Criteria
Phase I is complete when:
- All 5 features are implemented
- All tests pass
- CLI works end-to-end
- Repo contains: Constitution.md, specs/, phase-1-cli/src/, phase-1-cli/tests/, README.md, CLAUDE.md

# Project Constitution: Evolution-Todo Full-Stack Web Application

## Version

**Constitution Version:** 1.2.0

## Ratification

**Ratification Date:** 2025-12-11
**Last Amended:** 2025-12-11

## Project Overview

This Constitution governs Phase II of the Todo Evolution project: a full-stack web application that evolves the Todo app into a modern, multi-user system with authentication, database persistence, and a responsive interface. The app must support user registration, login, and isolated task lists per user. All development must follow Spec-Driven Development using Spec-Kit Plus, where specifications are refined iteratively to generate code without manual coding.

## Guiding Principles

### Principle 1: Spec-Driven Development Mandate

All code must be generated through refined specifications. Manual editing of generated source code is STRICTLY PROHIBITED. If code is incorrect, the corresponding spec (spec.md) MUST be refined and the generation process repeated. ALL source code (/frontend/, /backend/) MUST be generated by Claude Code by refining Markdown specifications in the /specs/ folder. This ensures traceability, consistency, and quality across the codebase.

**Rationale:** To maintain architectural integrity and ensure all code is specification-driven rather than ad-hoc implementation.

### Principle 2: Reusable Intelligence Integration

Incorporate subagents and agent skills where applicable for modular, reusable components. To qualify for the "+200 Bonus Points," the project MUST create and use at least one reusable intelligence component. This can be either:

- An AI Subagent (e.g., `specification-review-subagent`) defined using the Persona+Questions+Principles (P+Q+P) pattern
- An Agent Skill (e.g., `cloud-native-blueprint-skill`)
  This component must be documented in `/specs/reusable-intelligence/` and referenced in implementation. This ensures that the system is built with future extensibility in mind and maximizes the value of AI-assisted development.

**Rationale:** To create a maintainable and scalable architecture that leverages AI capabilities effectively.

### Principle 3: Clean Code Standards

Follow clean code principles: modularity, separation of concerns, readability, and maintainability. Code must be well-structured, documented where necessary, and follow established patterns for the technology stack.

**Rationale:** To ensure long-term maintainability and team collaboration effectiveness.

### Principle 4: Security-First Architecture
- Frontend Authentication: Next.js with Better Auth library ✅
- Better Auth Setup: runs as Next.js API routes ✅
- Token Management: Frontend stores JWT token ✅
- Backend Verification: FastAPI middleware verifies JWT ✅

Prioritize security in all implementations with JWT-based authentication. User data isolation must be absolute.

**Authentication Architecture:**
- **Frontend Authentication:** Next.js with Better Auth library handles user registration, login, and session management
- **Better Auth Setup:** Better Auth runs as Next.js API routes at `/app/api/auth/[...all]/route.ts` and issues JWT tokens on successful login
- **Token Management:** Frontend stores JWT token (in HTTP-only cookies or secure storage) and attaches it to every FastAPI request as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- **Backend Verification:** FastAPI middleware verifies JWT signature using shared `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` environment variable (NEVER hardcode this value)
- **User Isolation:** FastAPI extracts `user_id` from validated JWT token and filters ALL database queries by this authenticated user ID
- **Security Principle:** User ID comes from JWT token ONLY, never from URL parameters (prevents unauthorized access)

**Rationale:** To protect user data, maintain trust, and ensure proper separation between authentication (Next.js) and API logic (FastAPI).

### Principle 5: Usability and Responsiveness

Emphasize usability: the frontend must be responsive and intuitive. User experience must be prioritized in all interface decisions.

**Rationale:** To ensure user adoption and satisfaction with the application.

### Principle 6: Comprehensive Feature Integration

Integrate all levels of Todo features: Basic (Add, Delete, Update, View, Mark Complete), Intermediate (Priorities & Tags, Search & Filter, Sort Tasks), and Advanced (Recurring Tasks, Due Dates & Reminders with browser notifications).

**Rationale:** To provide a complete and feature-rich task management solution.

### Principle 7: Cloud-Native Blueprints

Develop and use Cloud-Native Blueprints via Agent Skills for spec-driven deployment preparation.

**Rationale:** To align with future phases and earn bonus points for advanced AI-driven deployment practices.

### Principle 8: Development Tools Compliance

All development processes must use official tools and standards:

- **GitHub Operations:** All commits/pushes MUST go through official GitHub MCP server
- **Code Context:** Use Context7 MCP server for codebase analysis and understanding
- **Authentication Library:** Use Better Auth npm package (NOT an MCP server) for authentication
- **Direct CLI Commands:** Direct git commands are forbidden for project code

**Note:** Better Auth is a library installed via npm (`npm install better-auth`), not an MCP server. MCP servers are used for tooling, not application dependencies.

**Rationale:** To ensure standardized development practices and maximize scoring potential.

### Principle 9: Strict Folder Structure Compliance

The project MUST follow the exact folder structure as mandated by the hackathon requirements:

```
evolution-of-todo/
├── phase-2-web/                  # Root folder for Phase 2
│   ├── frontend/                 # Next.js 16+ App Router

    ├── prompts/            # Prompt history records
    └── adr/                # Architecture decision records
```

**Rationale:** To ensure compliance with hackathon requirements and maintain consistent project organization.

### Principle 10: CI/CD Pipeline Compliance

All deployments must follow the established CI/CD pipeline rules:

- Frontend deployment branch: phase_2
- Backend API deployment branch: api.phase_2
- No manual Vercel/Netlify deploys allowed — everything via GitHub Actions

**Rationale:** To ensure consistent and automated deployment processes.

### Principle 11: Frontend Development Standards

Frontend development must adhere to these standards:

- **Framework:** Next.js 16+ with App Router, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- **Authentication:** Better Auth library configured with JWT plugin in `/app/api/auth/[...all]/route.ts`
- **API Communication:** All backend calls via centralized `/src/lib/api.ts` client with automatic JWT attachment
- **Component Architecture:** Server Components by default; Client Components only for interactivity
- **Better Auth Configuration:**
```typescript
  // app/api/auth/[...all]/route.ts
  import { auth } from '@/lib/auth';
  export const { GET, POST } = auth.handler;
```

**Rationale:** To ensure consistent frontend architecture and proper authentication integration.

### Principle 12: Backend Development Standards

Backend development must adhere to these standards:

- **Framework:** FastAPI with Python 3.13+, SQLModel, and Neon PostgreSQL
- **JWT Verification:** Middleware that verifies JWT tokens using `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` from environment
- **User Isolation:** All database queries automatically filtered by authenticated `user_id` from JWT
- **API Endpoints:** Six endpoints under `/api/tasks` (user ID from JWT, NOT URL)
- **Error Handling:** Proper HTTP status codes (401 for auth errors, 404 for not found, 403 for forbidden)

**Example FastAPI Middleware:**
```python
from fastapi import Depends, HTTPException, Header
from jose import jwt, JWTError

async def get_current_user(authorization: str = Header(None)):
    if not authorization or not authorization.startswith("Bearer "):
        raise HTTPException(401, "Missing or invalid token")
    token = authorization.split(" ")[1]
    try:
        payload = jwt.decode(token, settings.BETTER_AUTH_SECRET, algorithms=["HS256"])
        user_id = payload.get("sub")
        return user_id
    except JWTError:
        raise HTTPException(401, "Invalid token")
```

**Rationale:** To ensure secure, user-isolated API operations.



### Principle 13: Environment Variable Management

All secrets and configuration must be managed through environment variables:

- **Never commit secrets** to Git (use `.gitignore` for `.env` files)
- **Required Environment Variables:**
  - `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` (shared between Next.js and FastAPI)
  - `DATABASE_URL` (Neon PostgreSQL connection string)
  - `NEXTAUTH_URL` (Next.js app URL)
- **Development Setup:** Document required environment variables in README.md
- **Example `.env.example` file:**
```
  BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your-secret-here
  DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
  NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

**Rationale:** To prevent security breaches and maintain configuration flexibility across environments.


### FRONTEND CLAUDE.MD RULES (MANDATORY)

The `/frontend/CLAUDE.md` file MUST contain these patterns:

- **Stack:** Next.js 16+ (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Authentication:** Better Auth library (`npm install better-auth`) with JWT plugin
- **Auth Routes:** Better Auth API routes at `/app/api/auth/[...all]/route.ts`
- **API Client:** Centralized client at `/src/lib/api.ts` that:
  - Reads JWT token from Better Auth session
  - Attaches `Authorization: Bearer <token>` to all requests
  - Handles token refresh automatically
- **Component Patterns:**
  - Server Components by default
  - Client Components only for interactivity (`"use client"` directive)
- **File Structure:**
  - Components: `/src/components/`
  - Pages: `/src/app/`
  - Auth config: `/src/lib/auth.ts`
  - API client: `/src/lib/api.ts`
- **Example API Call:**
```typescript
  import { api } from '@/lib/api';
  const tasks = await api.getTasks(); // JWT attached automatically
```
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS only, no inline styles

###  BACKEND CLAUDE.MD RULES (MANDATORY)
The `/backend/CLAUDE.md` file MUST contain these exact patterns:
*   **Stack:** FastAPI, SQLModel, Neon PostgreSQL.
*   **Structure:** `main.py` (app entry), `models.py` (SQLModel), `routes/` (API handlers), `db.py` (connection).
*   **API Conventions:** All routes under `/api/`. Use Pydantic models for request/response validation.
*   **Database:** Connection string from `DATABASE_URL` env variable. Use SQLModel for all operations.
*   **Auth:** JWT verification middleware on every request. Extract user ID from token.
*   **Run Command:** `uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000`
*   **Errors:** Use `HTTPException` with appropriate status codes.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 16+ with TypeScript and App Router
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for responsive styling
- **Authentication:** Better Auth library (npm package) for JWT-based authentication
- **API Client:** Centralized API client in `/src/lib/api.ts` with automatic JWT token attachment
- **Database ORM:** Drizzle ORM for database interactions

### Backend Stack

- **Framework:** FastAPI with Python 3.13+
- **ORM:** SQLModel for database models and queries
- **Authentication:** JWT token verification middleware (using PyJWT library)
- **Shared Secret:** `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` environment variable shared with Next.js Better Auth

### Database Stack

- **Database:** Neon Serverless PostgreSQL
- **ORM:** SQLModel for backend, Drizzle for frontend

### Development Tools

- **Python Management:** UV for Python project management
- **Containerization:** Docker for containerization when needed
- **Spec-Driven Development:** Spec-Kit Plus for specification-driven development

## Architecture

### Monorepo Structure

The project follows a monorepo structure with clear separation:

- **/frontend:** Contains Next.js app with src/app for pages, src/components for UI elements, src/lib for utilities (auth, API clients, DB), and drizzle for schema
- **/backend:** Contains FastAPI app with src/models for SQLModel models, src/schemas for Pydantic schemas, src/routers for API endpoints, and tests for pytest
- **Root level:** Shared specs, configurations, documentation, and docker-compose.yml for setup



### Technical Constraints

- **API Endpoints:** Must implement the exact six (6) REST endpoints as specified in hackathon documentation:
```
  GET    /api/{user_id}/tasks
  POST   /api/{user_id}/tasks
  GET    /api/{user_id}/tasks/{id}
  PUT    /api/{user_id}/tasks/{id}
  DELETE /api/{user_id}/tasks/{id}
  PATCH  /api/{user_id}/tasks/{id}/complete
```
  
  **Security Requirement:** Despite `{user_id}` being in the URL, backend MUST verify that URL user_id matches JWT token user_id on every request. This prevents users from accessing other users' data by manipulating the URL.
  

### Frontend Architecture

- Next.js App Router for page routing and server-side rendering
- Component-based architecture with reusable UI components
- Client-side state management with proper error handling
- Responsive design following mobile-first principles
